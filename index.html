            <p>
                I'm a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/">Information Science at Cornell University</a>, based in NYC at Cornell Tech. I'm advised primarily by <a href="https://www.nixdell.com/">Nicola Dell</a> and <a href="https://destrin.tech.cornell.edu/">Deborah Estrin</a>.

                I design and build sociotechnical systems that help us care for each other. Lately I've been working on large-scale computational analysis of the language of online therapy; justice-oriented design of caregiving systems in home health; and computer security for victims and survivors of intimate partner violence. More fundamentally, I'm interested in mitigating the harms caused by technocratic largesse through feminist approaches to the design and development of computing systems.

            <p>
                I earned a B.A. from Princeton University and an M.S. from Cornell Tech. In previous lives I made radio,
                print
                and multimedia journalism, developed mathematical models for disease spread and ran early-stage product
                development at a consumer health tech startup. I've also worked as a healthcare consultant in the U.S. and taught
                software
                engineering.
